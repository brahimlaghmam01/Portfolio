## Important: Add Your Resume PDF

To enable the resume download functionality, you need to add your resume PDF file to the project.

   - Create or export your professional resume as a PDF file
   - Name it `resume.pdf`

2. **Add to the public folder**
   - Place the `resume.pdf` file in the `/public` folder
   - Path should be: `/public/resume.pdf`

3. **The download button will automatically work**
   - The button is already implemented in the navigation bar
   - It will download the file as `Brahim_Laghmam_Resume.pdf`

### Current Status:
- ✅ Download button added to navigation
